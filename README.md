## Projects

### Formalisation

This project aims to formalize various AI concepts and algorithms. It includes a collection of Jupyter notebooks that discuss different formal methods applied in AI.

#### Examples:

- Formalising search algorithms
- Implementing graph algorithms
- Encoding logical rules

### Heuristic Research

This project focuses on researching various heuristics used in AI algorithms. The Jupyter notebooks cover different heuristic techniques and how they are applied in optimization and decision-making problems.

#### Examples:

- A* pathfinding with different heuristics
- Genetic algorithms with heuristic evaluation
- Simulated annealing with heuristic scoring

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hectellian/13X005-AI.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd AI-Projects
   ```

3. **Install Poetry**

   If you haven't already installed Poetry, you can do so by following the instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

4. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

## Usage

1. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

2. **Run Jupyter Notebooks**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Once the Jupyter server starts, you can navigate to the project notebooks and run them.
